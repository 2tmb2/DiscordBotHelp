# DiscordBotHelp
Little templates and helpful pieces of code i have made over the years. I've been making bots for a while now and I want to share some of the tips, tricks, and useful copy and pastes I've made. If you need help/support feel free to message me on my [discord server](https://discord.gg/A7aQfW6).
