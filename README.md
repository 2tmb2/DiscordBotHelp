## DiscordBotHelp

Little templates and helpful pieces of code i have made over the years. I've been making bots for a while now and I want to share some of the tips, tricks, and useful copy and pastes I've made. If you need help/support feel free to message me on my [discord server](https://discord.gg/A7aQfW6).

## About me

I have been coding for many years. I used to make twitch bots but now I make professional discord bots on [fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/nex_infinite). I have made many bots over the last couple of months and so I've needed to make templates of code so I dont have to write out the same program over and over. This has now turned into this Repo. I also make bots for the public. A couple of my popular bots are:

* [Translator+](https://top.gg/bot/700793365754806402)
* [Chess](https://top.gg/bot/716382796108660826) - New
* [Space](https://top.gg/bot/716615705793134633) - New

I've got to the stage where I feel comfortable saying that I know what im doing and so I have decided to share all my knowledge to everyone else. I hope you can find something useful out of my organized mess.
